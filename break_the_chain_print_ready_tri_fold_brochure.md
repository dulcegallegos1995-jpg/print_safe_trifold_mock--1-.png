## INSIDE PANELS

### INSIDE LEFT PANEL

**Section Title:**
THE CHAINS WE DON’T SEE

**Body Copy:**
Some restraints are inherited.
Some are learned.
Some are enforced quietly, daily, until they feel normal.

They look like compliance.
They sound like silence.
They feel like shrinking.

### INSIDE CENTER PANEL (ANCHOR MESSAGE)

**Hero Visual:**
Breaking chain / light burst imagery

**Headline:**
BREAKING THE CHAINS OF THE PAST

**Core Message:**
Freedom is not forgetting.
It is choosing differently.

You are allowed to outgrow what once protected you.

### INSIDE RIGHT PANEL

**Section Title:**
WHAT COMES AFTER

**Bullet Points (Light, Affirming):**
• Boundaries without apology
• Strength without hardness
• Softness without fear
• Movement without permission

**Closing Line:**
The chain breaks when you decide it does.
